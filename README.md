#DTUAV: A Novel Cloud-Based Digital Twin System for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
Here, we provide a framework to build a two-way interaction system for robots. In this system, three subsystems are developed. 

---Server system: Cloud Server, Local Server, VR Server

---Virtual system: Unity-based Simulator and Matlab Interface

---Physical system: PX4-based Quadrotor with 4G and 5G network
